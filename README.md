# Jester-Bot
Bot that will help brighten your day by telling you a joke about a specific topic! (Profile pic is Jevil from Deltarune by Toby Fox! I just really like Jester-like/cartoony-like characters in games/stories!)

Jester comes with three main functions: Saying hello, telling jokes, and filtering itself!
# Introducing itself
The hello command can be activated using any of the three popular ways of saying hello: $hello, $hi, $hey
This will cause Jester to say hello in its own unique way from the dictionary of intros
# Joking around
The joke command, $joke, can be called by itself or putting something afterwards. If more words are after the command, it will act as a search for those specific jokes
# Filtering
The filter command, $filter, will keep all of its jokes within a certain margin. Jester will update you on what filters are on or off!
To turn on a specific filter, put in the filter name after the command and it will update. Jester can only handle one filter at a time!
Current filters include: not safe for work (nsfw), religious, political, racist, and sexist

# To Do List
Function to be added: If Jester is running and it has not been pinged within 3 days, it will automatically post the fitness gram pacer test. (Why? Because he refuses to let that joke die!)
If any ideas come to mind, I will update this list!
