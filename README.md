# Jester-Bot
Bot that will help brighten your day by telling you a joke about a specific topic! (Profile pic is Jevil from Deltarune by Toby Fox! I just really like Jester-like/cartoony-like characters in games/stories!)

Jester comes with three main functions: Saying hello, telling jokes, and filtering itself!
# Introducing itself
The hello command can be activated using any of the three popular ways of saying hello: $hello, $hi, $hey.
This will cause Jester to say hello in its own unique way from the dictionary of intros

$introduce command can be used to introduce itself to the server!
# Joking around
The joke command, $joke, can be called by itself or putting something afterwards. If more words are after the command, it will act as a search for those specific jokes
# Filtering
The filter command, $filter, will keep all of its jokes within a certain margin. Jester will update you on what filters are on or off!
To turn on a specific filter, put in the filter name after the command and it will update. Jester can only handle one filter at a time!

Current filters include: not safe for work (nsfw), religious, political, racist, and sexist

NOTE: racist and sexist filters automatically are on because it is 2021 and jokes can get people canceled

# To Do List
Function to be added: If Jester is running and it has not been pinged within 3 days, it will automatically post the fitness gram pacer test. (Why? Because he refuses to let that joke die!)

Need to handle spam messaging

Function to be added: Jester should be able to take and keep jokes that other users tell it about

Need to figure out how to post token without bot security in risk

If any ideas come to mind, I will update this list!
